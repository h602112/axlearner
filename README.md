A web based application to help with learning guitar

This is a web based web application created using the python framework Flask.

The plan is to implement functionality so that a user can search for a song, get guitar video lesson suggestion about that song. The chords of the song, and other tools that can help.

Currently working on integrating and building the video functionality using youtube's api.
